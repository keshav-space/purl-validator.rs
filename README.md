**purl-validator** is a Rust library for validating [Package URLs (PURLs)](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec). It works fully offline, including in **air-gapped** or **restricted environments**, and answers one key question: **Does the package this PURL represents actually exist?**

## How It Works?

**purl-validator** is shipped with a pre-built FST (Finite State Transducer), a set of compact automata containing latest Package URLs mined by the MineCode[^1]. Library uses this FST to perform lookups and confirm whether the **base PURL**[^2] exists.

## Currently Supported Ecosystems

- **nuget**: [https://www.nuget.org/](https://www.nuget.org/)

## Usage

Add `purl-validator` to your Rust dependency

```bash
cargo add purl-validator
```

Use it in your code like this

```rust
use purl_validator::validate;

let result: bool = validate("pkg:nuget/FluentValidation");
```
